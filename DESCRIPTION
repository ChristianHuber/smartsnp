Description: Fast computation of multivariate analyses of small (10s to 100s markers) to big (1000s to 100000s) genotype data. Runs Principal Component Analysis allowing for centering, z-score standardization and scaling for genetic drift, projection of ancient samples to modern genetic space and multivariate tests for differences in group location (Permutation-Based Multivariate Analysis of Variance) and dispersion (Permutation-Based Multivariate Analysis of Dispersion).
